Hi, my name is Pritpal Panesar. I'm currently a Platform Engineer with [Kainos](https://kainos.com).

I've had many roles over my career from developer, development team manager, system architect and release engineer.

This blog has some random musings on the various issues/tasks I perform. My role mainly involves working with [Azure](https://portal.azure.com) at the moment. Usually, finding information can be easy enough to do, but every so often there just isn't any information (or just not enough) that is useful.
